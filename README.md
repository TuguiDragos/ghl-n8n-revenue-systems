## 👋 Intro

Welcome to my automation workspace.

This repository contains **real-world inspired automation blueprints**, built with  
💡 **GoHighLevel** for frontend client capture & communication  
⚙️ **n8n** for backend orchestration, filtering, and logic.

My goal is simple:  
> Replace chaos with flow.  
> Turn manual processes into scalable systems.

## 🔧 What’s inside this repo?

You’ll find **demo workflows**, each designed for one core revenue function.  
All workflows are modular and can be adapted to fit different business cases.

| Workflow | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `lead-capture-workflow.json` | Captures lead from GHL → Sends welcome email → Adds to CRM → Slack notify |
| `calendar-reminder-workflow.json` | Sends automated email/SMS reminders for appointments booked in GHL |
| `crm-segmentation-workflow.json` | Adds tags & segments leads based on conditions → Moves them in pipeline |

Each file is exported directly from **n8n**, ready to be imported and used.
